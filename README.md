Analysis

Import data: Start by importing the raw data into Python using a data analysis library such as Pandas. This will allow you to manipulate and analyze the data in a structured manner.

Data cleaning: Before conducting any analysis, it is important to clean the data. This involves removing any missing or invalid data, checking for outliers and errors, and transforming the data into a format that is suitable for analysis.

Total participants: 257
Unrielable* participants: 61

*Particpants with answering 3 or 4 on PAS and asnwering NO GRATING in more than 10% of trials. (mean = 32.63%; std = 17.61)


Descriptive statistics: Calculate descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations, and frequencies for each variable to get an overview of the data.

Data visualization: Use data visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to explore the data and identify any patterns or relationships.

Hypothesis testing: Use statistical tests such as t-tests or ANOVA to test hypotheses about the data. This will help determine if there are any significant differences or relationships between variables.

Correlation analysis: Calculate correlation coefficients to examine the strength and direction of the relationship between variables.

Regression analysis: Conduct regression analysis to determine the extent to which one variable predicts another variable.

Factor analysis: Use factor analysis to identify underlying factors or dimensions that explain the relationships among variables.

Interpret results: Finally, interpret the results of the analysis and draw conclusions based on the findings. Make sure to communicate your findings in a clear and concise manner using visual aids such as graphs and tables.
